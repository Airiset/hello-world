# hello-world
Hello! Hey!
My name is... Well, that's not necessary to be known.
However, I'll tell you one thing: English is not my first language.
...
You still there?
...
Good! I thought you had a problem with my language problems. It is not difficult, but
it is hard for me, as a person, to communicate physically. I am better at talking 
through a machine. 
Anyways... Sousei no Omnyouji is my favourite manga ("favourite" - yeah, I live in Canada... 
We do say 'eh' a lot!).
That's it for now...

I've been thinking of building a citation program. Now that I am approaching University -one year to go!!- I've thought of developing something that I can make some money from in order save for school. They've not given me a job, yet. That McDonald's job interview seemed to go pretty well, however, they told me they were putting the orientation date on determination... Was that a troll?
