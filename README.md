# hello-world
Hello! Hey!
My name is... Well, that's not necessary to be known.
However, I'll tell you one thing: English is not my first language.
...
You still there?
...
Good! I thought you had a problem with my language 'problems'. It is not difficult, but
it is hard for me, as a person, to communicate with others. I am better at talking 
through a machine. 
Anyways... Sousei no Omnyouji is my favourite manga ("favourite" - yeah, I live in Canada... 
We do say 'eh' a lot!).
That's it for now...

Trying to learn how to write clean code!

I've been thinking of building a citation program. Now that I am approaching University -one year to go!!- I've thought of developing something that I can make some money from in order save for school. They've not given me a job, yet. That McDonald's job interview seemed to go pretty well, however, they told me they were putting the orientation date on determination... Was that a troll?

So, I got called to an McDonald's orientation last week. It was Wednesday. It was fine. Now I got to wait when they give me my training... I wish my fractured toe got better for that day. Getting to the actual place is difficult, so I'll have to change my availability based on the bus hours.

SO! My ideas for the citation program I was thinking about! Cito!:
Create a web-plugin tool to which you can save all pages you visit and it saves its links and creates a citation.
Create a file requirement in webpages with a cit.txt file which contains all the citations of a webpage.
A citation tool for web-pages, which lets users save citations to those pages with a click.
A citation connects to another source which in part may have another citation. A crawler must be able to search through it.
